psipy.py
========

PsiPy is a Python solver for the 2D Schrodinger equation. This package
is based on the 1D Schrodinger equation solver schrodinger.py built by
Jake Vanderplas and Andre Xuereb.

schrodinger.py
==============

pySchrodinger is a Python solver for the 1D Schrodinger equation. This
package is a modification of code first publicized at
http://jakevdp.github.com/blog/2012/09/05/quantum-python/

Authors
-------
- Jake Vanderplas (original author)
- Andre Xuereb (contributed normalization & imaginary time step)
- Luke Siemens (improved imaginary time step and switched to p-space)

units.py
========

The package units.py impliments the seamless conversion of units 
from Hartree atomic units as used in the schrodinger equation 
solvers to SI units.
